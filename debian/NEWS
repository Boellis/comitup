comitup (1.3.1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

    The default number of digits in the ap_name has been reduced from
    four to two. Use the "ap_name" configuration variable if you wish
    to change this back.

comitup (1.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    The base_name configuration variable has been removed, and
    replaced by ap_name. The new variable lets you define the
    presence and length of the persistent random number in the AP
    name. See the comitup-conf man page or the install comitup.conf
    file for details.
